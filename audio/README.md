Place optional licensed audio stems here to override the procedural fallback music.

Expected files:
- `pokemon-layer-1.ogg`
- `pokemon-layer-2.ogg`
- `pokemon-layer-3.ogg`
- `pokemon-layer-4.ogg`
- `pokemon-layer-5.ogg`

All files should share the same tempo and loop length so they stay synchronized.
If any stem is missing, the app falls back to synthesized music.
